Graduate students from Colorado State University visited Argonne National Laboratory to work with the Sage team on connecting and testing soil moisture sensors on Sage Devices. They set up both hardwired and LoRaWAN (long-range wireless) sensors, laying the groundwork for creating start-to-finish workflows that process data in real time. These workflows help researchers, ranchers, and policymakers quickly detect environmental changes, spot unusual conditions, and turn data from field devices into useful, on-the-ground insights.
