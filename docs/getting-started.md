# Getting Started with Sage

Welcome to Sage, a distributed software-defined sensor network that enables intelligent edge computing. This guide will help you get started based on your specific needs and expertise.

## What is Sage?

Sage is a cyberinfrastructure platform that deploys intelligent sensor nodes across remote and urban environments. These nodes can:

- **Collect data** from various sensors (infrared cameras, RGB cameras, LiDAR, and traditional sensors for air quality and wind, as well as LoRaWAN connected sensors for low-bandwidth measurements such as soil moisture)
- **Process data locally** using machine learning algorithms and AI models on embedded computers
- **Transmit results** to central servers for further analysis
- **Enable real-time monitoring** and automated responses and insights to events
