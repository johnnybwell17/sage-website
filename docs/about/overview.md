# Sage: A distributed software-defined sensor network.

## What is Sage?


Geographically distributed sensor systems that include cameras, microphones, and weather and air quality stations can generate such large volumes of data that fast and efficient analysis is best performed by an embedded computer connected directly to the sensor. Sage is exploring new techniques for applying machine learning algorithms to data from such intelligent sensors and then building reusable software that can run programs within the embedded computer and transmit the results over the network to central computer servers. Distributed, intelligent sensor networks that can collect and analyze data are an essential tool for scientists seeking to understand the impacts of global urbanization, natural disasters such as flooding and wildfires, and changes on natural ecosystems and city infrastructure.

Sage is deploying sensor nodes that support machine learning frameworks in environmental testbeds in California, Colorado, and Kansas and in urban environments in Illinois and Texas. The reusable cyberinfrastructure running on these testbeds will give scientists new data for building models to study these coupled systems. The software components developed are open source and provide an open architecture to enable scientists from a wide range of fields to build their own intelligent sensor networks.

Partners are deploying testbeds in Australia, Japan, UK, and Taiwan, providing scientists with even more data for analysis. The toolkit is also extending the current educational curriculum used in Chicago to inspire young people – with an emphasis on women and minorities, to pursue science, technology, and mathematics careers – by providing a platform for students to explore measurement-based science questions related to the natural and built environments.

The data from sensors and applications is hosted in the cloud to facilitate easy data analysis.
